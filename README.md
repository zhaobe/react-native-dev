# Getting Started with React Native

- Downloaded the react-native 0.38.0 version with ```react-native init AwesomeProject --version 0.38.0```
- To run, open AwesomeProject.xcodeproj in XCode and run ios simulator to render app.
- Had to clear cache with ```npm start -- --reset-cache``` in order to get the ios simulator to be error-free.
